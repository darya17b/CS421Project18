## What's New (User Facing)
 * Created standardized script format
 * Created database
 * Created web server
 * Created front end UI

## Work Summary (Developer Facing)
This sprint, we began implementation and created a workable prototype. We worked with our client and used their input to create a json file as well as backend structs to store the user data. We were able to demonstrate our prototype to our client. We ran into some issues with MongoDB Atlas and decided to instead run the database locally. Overall, we had a successful sprint. 

## Unfinished Work
We finished all planned work for this Sprint. Some of our features may be further developed in future Sprints, but we completed our objectives.
