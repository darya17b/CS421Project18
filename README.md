# VCC Standardized Patient File Management System

## Project summary

### One-sentence description of the project

We are developing a file management system for the Virtual Clinical Center at the WSU Elson S Floyd College of Medicine that will standardize the scripts they use for actors playing various patients in their clinic. 

### Additional information about the project

The Elson S.Floyd College of Medicine Virtual Clinic Center (VCC) is a simulation-based training center, allowing medical students to practice with manikins as well as real people acting out example patient situations. This is called Standardized Patient Simulation. The interactions simulate experience for medical students without the high stakes of a real patient. The actors involved in these scenarios receive information on the patient they are portraying through documents known as scripts. Scripts contain a plethora of important information for the actors, the students, as well as the facilitators of the simulation. The actor learns what symptoms they should portray and how to talk about them, as well as how their character is feeling. The scripts also contain door notes, which the student will view before participating in the simulation. The door notes mimic, again, a real situation in which the doctor would be given some information on the patient and their background before entering the room to see the patient. 
With the importance that the scripts play in the VCC, the file management system should be able to keep up with the fast pace necessary in medical education. The current system for creating, editing, finding, and reusing scripts is inefficient. The VCC is hoping for a file system that will provide easy access to scripts, allow searching and editing, generate information such as door notes from the scripts, and increase general efficiency. The objectives as outlined by the VCC are to create a standardized script form, be able to access information from the scripts, be able to easily update the scripts each year, and be able to search for the scripts.
